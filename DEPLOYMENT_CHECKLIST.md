# Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Health Endpoints
- [x] Added `/health` endpoint to Flask app (`backend/standardized_app.py`)
- [x] Added `/health` endpoint to Node.js server (`backend/server.js`)
- [x] Verified existing `/api/health` endpoints work

### 2. Port Configuration
- [x] Updated Flask app to use PORT environment variable
- [x] Updated render.yaml to use port 5004 for ML service
- [x] Added proper os import to Flask app

### 3. Startup Scripts
- [x] Created `start_ml_service.py` with error handling
- [x] Created `start_node_service.js` with error handling
- [x] Updated render.yaml to use custom startup scripts

### 4. Deployment Verification
- [x] Created `verify_deployment.py` for build-time checks
- [x] Created `test_flask_startup.py` for Flask testing
- [x] Created `test_node_startup.js` for Node.js testing
- [x] Created `health_check.py` for runtime verification

### 5. Configuration Files
- [x] Updated `render.yaml` with proper configuration
- [x] Verified `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- [x] Verified `package.json` has correct scripts

## üîß Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] `MONGODB_URI` is set in Render dashboard
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` is set in Render dashboard
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` is set in Render dashboard
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` = production (set in render.yaml)
- [ ] `FLASK_ENV` = production (set in render.yaml)

### Repository
- [ ] All files are committed to Git
- [ ] Repository is connected to Render
- [ ] Branch is set to main/master

### Services Configuration
- [ ] Backend service configured with Node.js environment
- [ ] ML service configured with Python environment
- [ ] Both services have correct root directory (`backend`)
- [ ] Health check paths are correctly set

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Push Changes to Git**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues and add health endpoints"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Render**
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Services should auto-deploy if connected to Git
   - Monitor build logs for any errors

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check that both services show "Live" status
   - Test health endpoints:
     - Backend: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/health`
     - ML Service: `https://your-ml-service.onrender.com/health`

4. **Test Functionality**
   - Test basic API endpoints
   - Verify ML service responds to requests
   - Check database connectivity

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Health Checks Fail
1. Check build logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify health endpoints are accessible
3. Check that services are starting correctly

### If Services Won't Start
1. Review startup script logs
2. Check for missing dependencies
3. Verify environment variables are set

### If Import Errors Occur
1. Check requirements.txt has all dependencies
2. Verify Python version compatibility
3. Check for missing files in repository

## üìã Files Modified

- `backend/standardized_app.py` - Added health endpoint and port configuration
- `backend/server.js` - Added health endpoint
- `render.yaml` - Updated configuration and startup commands
- `backend/start_ml_service.py` - New startup script with error handling
- `backend/start_node_service.js` - New startup script with error handling
- `backend/verify_deployment.py` - New deployment verification script
- `backend/test_flask_startup.py` - New Flask testing script
- `backend/test_node_startup.js` - New Node.js testing script
- `backend/health_check.py` - New health check script
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - New deployment documentation

## üéØ Expected Outcome

After deployment:
- Both services should show "Live" status in Render
- Health endpoints should return 200 status codes
- Services should be able to communicate with each other
- Database connections should work properly
- All API endpoints should be functional

## üìû Support

If deployment fails:
1. Check Render logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all checklist items are completed
3. Test services locally before deploying
4. Review the deployment guide for additional troubleshooting steps
